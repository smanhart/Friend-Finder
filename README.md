# Friend-Finder

This is my first full stack project. The goal was to build an application that could take in information from an HTML site on the front end and send it to the server through the api. I coded the back end server JavaScript using Node, the HTML and front end JavaScript,  and the api routes to pass the information back and forth.

This has been deployed to Heroku, which you can find [here.](https://infinite-retreat-27200.herokuapp.com/)

From the home screen, click the survey button to be taken to the questions. Enter your name and a link to a picture for your profile, then answer the ten questions with how much you agree or disagree. If either the name or picture field is left blank, an alert will pop up to remind you to fill them out. Once you hit submit, a modal will pop up with the closest match to your answers.  After you dismiss the match notification, the page will reload so the survey can be taken again. 

You can also view the list of friends the program is pulling from by clicking the API Friends List link at the bottom of the page.
